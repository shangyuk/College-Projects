					<h2>Research 1: Image Slider</h2>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<div class="left">
							<div class="card">
								<img src="../Images/Research/1a.png">
								WEEBSITE!!!
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="right">
							<div class="card">
								<a href="https://www.daraz.com.np/#" target="_blank"><img src="../Images/Research/1b.png"></a>
								Daraz
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The image slider concept for this website has been inspired from daraz website. In daraz, the image slider is on the top. Advertisements are displayed in the slider which constantly change after certain time or can be manually changed by clicking on the small white circles at the bottom. In Weebsite, the image slider is present in the home page and displays a short description on the four other pages in the website. The image changes every 3.5 seconds or can be changed by clicking on the right or left button. In daraz, the image links to the product of the advertisement, and in Weebsite the image links to their respective pages.

					<h2>Research 2: Header and Navigation Bar</h2>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<div class="left">
							<div class="card">

								WEEBSITE!!!

						</div>

							<div class="card">
								<a href="https://alphamysteryblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../Images/Research/2b.png"></a>
								ALPHAMYSTERY
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The header and navigation bar has been referenced from alphamystery website. The positioning of logo, website name and navigation bar has been inspired from this website. The idea of navigation bar sticking to the top of the page when scrolled down, was also taken from this website. In Weebsite, clicking on the website name or logo also redirects the page to home page.  While in alphamystery,in navigation bar, the active page is shown with red text and the hover effect is the text colour changing to red, in Weebsite, the active page's navigation link is highlighted in red and the hover effect is changing of link background to opaque black colour. The header in Weebsite also covers lesser visible window space than that of alphamystery. The colour combination is also contrasting; alphamystery, black text and white background; Weebsite!!!, white text and dark background.

					<h2>Research 3: Side Navigation Bar</h2>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<div class="left">
							<div class="card">
								<img src="../Images/Research/3a.png">
								WEEBSITE!!!
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="right">
							<div class="card">
								<a href="http://mammothmedia.tv/" target="_blank"><img src="../Images/Research/3b.png"></a>
								Mammoth Media
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The content navigation bar (the small table of content on the left), of blog page was inspired from mammothmedia website. While in mamothmedia, the side navigation bar is the main navigation bar of the website, in Weebsite, the concept has been used for navigation of the content present in the blog page of the website. The navigation bar can be used to immediately scroll to specific part of the blog in the same page in Weebsite, but in mammothmedia, the navigation bar links to other pages of the website. In terms of design, the navigation bar cover the whole vertical space on the left of mammothmedia's webpage and is present in all webpages of the website, whereas in Weebsite, the side navigation bar is only present in blog page and is compact in size, but has fixed position in the browser window i.e. even if the page is scrolled, the navigation bar remains.

					<h2>Research 4: Footer</h2>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<div class="left">
							<div class="card">
								<img src="../Images/Research/4a.png">
								WEEBSITE!!!
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="right">
							<div class="card">
								<a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../Images/Research/4b.png"></a>
								ZurbFoundation
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The footer for this page was inspired from zurb foundation website. The social media icons on the right side of the footer, link to the site's respective social media pages. The same idea has been applied in Weebsite where, instead of using only outlines of the social media symbol, a cicular icon has been used. The footer of Weebsite also doesn't have any other links besides a link on the left, which is the developer name, that links to the CV page of the website.

					<h2>Research 5: Contact Page</h2>
					<div style="display: flex;">
						<div class="left">
							<div class="card">

								WEEBSITE!!!
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="right">
							<div class="card">
								<a href="https://groverwebdesign.com/#contact" target="_blank"><img src="../Images/Research/5b.png"></a>
								GroverWebDesign (GWD)
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The layout for the content page inclined towards that of grover web design's (GWD) website. Weebsite's message form ,contact details and social media link icons positioning were inspired from GWD's website. The main difference is that the contact us section in GWD's webpage is part of the footer whereas in Weebsite, contact us has a dedicated page in the website. In GWD, if the fields in contact form have not been filled, a message appears below the form, showing validation error, but in Weebsite, a pop up essage appears. In Weebsite, when the form is submitted after filling it completely, a new window with thanking gif is opened.
